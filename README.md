# Automation

Code I wrote during my internship for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The task was to automate tests for an online application for quality assurance. 

Files and methods I did not write:
- MarkLogicDatabase.java
- mediaXMLhtmlAudioConf.java
- mediaXMLhtmlVideoConf.java
- FileUtil.java
- LDSNamespace.java
- MarkLogicUtils.java
- XMLUtils.java: getNodeListFromXpath (String, String)
- XMLUtils.java: getNodeListFromXpath (File, String)
- XMLUtils.java: getNodeListFromXpath (Document, String, NamespaceContext)
- XMLUtils.java: getDocumentAsXmlString
- XMLUtils.java: getDocumentFromFile
- ExampleFT.java: findMediaXml
- ExampleFT.java: findHtml5ByFileId
- ExampleFT.java: readFileFromMarkLogic
- ExampleFT.java: checkExistenceLdsMeta_ldsTitle
- ExampleFT.java: checkMediaNodes
- ExampleFT.java: processConferenceMediaByExample
- ExampleFT.java: getCoverArtMap

Everything else is code I wrote. Some of it is unfinished because I did not have enough time before my internship was over. I worked on this code for about four weeks while working on other things as well. The code I did not write was written by a lead developer as a framework to help get me and two other engineers started on automation.
